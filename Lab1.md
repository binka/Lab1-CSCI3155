  1.  The pi at line 4 is bound by line 3 as it is declared within a function one line above it.  
    It's scope is only limited to within the circumfrence function.  The pi at line 7 is bound by line 1 as it declared
    within a function but since there is no re-decleration of pi within the area function, it has to get it's value from 
    line 1.
